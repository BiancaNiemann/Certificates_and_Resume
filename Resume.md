## ðŸ‘¤ About Me
Iâ€™m a BI & Data Analyst with a strong foundation in SQL, Python, Tableau, BigQuery, dbt, and Databricks â€” passionate about transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable insights.

With over 20 years of experience in payroll and finance, I bring a business-first perspective to analytics. 

â€‹Iâ€™ve built interactive dashboards, written complex queries, cleaned and structured messy datasets, and designed ETL/ELT pipelines â€” always with the goal of making data truly serve the business.

â€‹Core Tools & Skills
SQL | Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) | Tableau | BigQuery | dbt | Databricks | Data Cleaning & Transformation | Data Visualization | BI Reporting | ETL/ELT | Looker Studio

What I Bring
ðŸ”¹ A business-first mindset rooted in finance and payroll expertise
ðŸ”¹ Strong process optimization skills
ðŸ”¹ A knack for turning data into meaningful stories

â€‹Iâ€™m a people-oriented professional who thrives in collaborative environments but also enjoys working independently. I value honesty, work hard, and approach challenges with curiosity and positivity.

â€‹Outside of work, youâ€™ll find me mountain biking, taking long walks, solving puzzles, or getting lost in a good book.

â€‹ðŸš€ Next Steps
Iâ€™m seeking an entry-level data analytics role where I can combine my analytical skills with my financial background to deliver valuable insights and support data-driven decision-making. Iâ€™m eager to contribute to impactful projects in a collaborative, innovative environment while continuing to grow my technical expertise.
